Project Title

Resistor Color Code Calculator & Electronics Utility App

Project Overview

The Resistor Color Code Calculator is a mobile application designed for electronics students, beginners, hobbyists, technicians, and PCB designers to quickly and accurately identify resistor values and perform common electronics calculations.

The app addresses the common challenge of understanding and memorizing resistor color codes by providing an interactive and intuitive digital solution. Instead of relying on charts or guesswork, users can visually select resistor bands or input resistance values to instantly obtain accurate results.

Beyond basic color code conversion, the app evolves into a compact electronics utility by including essential calculators frequently used during circuit design, testing, and troubleshooting.
